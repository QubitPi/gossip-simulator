              <h1>What’s a Gossip Protocol?</h1>
              <p>Gossip protocols are a communication protocol, a way of broadcast messages inspired by:<br>
              Epidemics, Human gossip, Social networks</p>

              <h1>How do they work?</h1>
              <p> The basic idea behind them is this: A node wants to share some information to the other nodes in the network. Then periodically it selects rand
      omly a node from the set of nodes and exchanges the information. The node that receives the information does exactly the same thing.  Normally the information is sent pe
      riodically to N targets, not just one, N is called fanout.</p>

              <h1>What is it used for?</h1>
              <p>A primary use of gossip is for information diffusion: some event occurs, and our goal is to spread the word [1]. But they're used for Database replication, Information dissemination, Cluster membership, Failure Detectors, Overlay Networks, Aggregations </p>

              <h2 class="featurette-heading">Let's play with the simulator. </h2>
              <p>As already mentioned above Gossip protocols are executed periodically, that is, in cycles. That's what the word cycle means, it will rotate in every cycle, don't worry you'll see it really soon.</p>
              <p class="text-muted">Ok, and what about the equation?</p>
              <p>The equation is an aproximation, it will show you how many cycles the gossip protocol needs to spread the information to every node, if you want to see a converge simulator that takes into account packet loss, node failures, etc <a class="" href="https://www.serf.io/docs/internals/simulator.html">see</a></p>
              <p class="">Select a node. Go, click in any of them, the node should be red now, that's because it's infected as it's called in [2].</p>
              <p class="">This node wants to share the information, but to what nodes? click in 'show paths', those are the nodes is linked to. So each node has a partial view of the other nodes? It could have a complete list but that would make the protocol difficult to scale (think in thunsands/millions of nodes), please read [3] if you want to learn more. </p>
            <p class="text-muted">Go to the next part</p>
            </div>

            <div class="item">
              <h2 class="featurette-heading">Sending messages</h2>
             <p> <span class="text-muted">Ok, It will send the info to those nodes, right?</span> No, the number of nodes is set by the fanout property. Click in 'Random selection' to see the nodes it's going to share the info to, click several times you'll see that they're selected randomly.</p>
             <p>Great! Now, let's send the info, click in "Send Message" </p>
              <p class="">Once a message arrives to destination, that node is infected too, and as we've already mentioned once a node is infected it'll try to share the information again with other nodes.</p>
              <p class="">Click again in "Send Message".</p>
              <p class="">cool! right? Every infected node tries to share the information</p>
              <p class="">It's time to see it in action. Press "Restart" to clean everything, then click in any node and press "Play".</p>
              <p class="text-muted">How many cycles?</p> It's likely that the number of cycles the equation predicts is not the same, don't worry it's normal, take into account that the nodes are selected randomly, so it can happens that a node is selected twice.
          </div>
            <div class="item">
              <h2 class="featurette-heading">Scaling</h2>
              <p> They are scalable because in general, it takes O(logN) rounds to reach all nodes. Also each node sends only a fixed number of messages independent of the number of nodes in the network. A node does not wait for acknowledgments, and it doesn’t take any recovery action if an acknowledgment does not arrive. [4]. A system can easily scale to millions of processes. Updates spread in expected time that grows logarithmic in the number of participating hosts, even in the face of host failures and message loss.</p> <p>Let's see in action, but first, <span class="text-muted">lets restart the simulator.</span></p>
              <p class="">Change the nodes to 80 and press "Apply". Ohh Did you see it? </p>
              <p class="">We've doubled the number of nodes and according to the equation it will take only once more cycle. That's cool, right?</p>
              <p class="">Let's see in action, select a node and click play</p>
              <p class="">Let's try now with 120, wow so for 40 nodes it takes 2.66 cycles and for 120 3.45. That's pretty cool, it means it scales logarithmically.</p>
          </div>

            <div class="item">
             <h2 class="featurette-heading">Fault Tolerant</h2>
             <p> They have the ability to operate in networks with irregular and unknown connectivity [1]. They work really well in these situations because a node shares the same information several times to different nodes, so if a node is not accesible the information is shared anyways through a different route. In other words there are many routes by which information can flow from its source to its destinations</p>
             <p> <span class="text-muted">Ok, let's see it.</span> Same as before, restart the simulator first.</p>
             <p class="">We're going to delete some links, which means that some nodes are not going to be able to communicate with some nodes.</p>
             <p>Click in a node and in "Show Paths", then in "Delete" and start clicking in some paths.</p>
             <p>We're going to repeat the same with more nodes, but very important <span class="text-muted">Press "Delete" again to disable it </span> because otherwise you will remove nodes too and that's something that will see in the next step.</p>
             <p>Ok, repeat it with more nodes and the select one node and press "Play" </p>
             <p>Pretty cool, right? It converges even though some nodes weren't visible by others.</p>
          </div>

            <div class="item">
             <h2 class="featurette-heading">Robust</h2>
             <p>No node plays a specific role in the network, so a failed node will not prevent other nodes from continuing sending messages [16].  Each node can join or leave whenever it pleases without seriously disrupting the system’s overall quality of service [5] They’re not robust in all circumstances, for example with Byzantine errors, if the problem is related to a malfunctioning nodes or malicious then gossip is not robust at all. </p>
             <p> <span class="text-muted">Ok, let's see it.</span> Same as before, restart the simulator first.</p>
             <p class="">We're going to delete some nodes, a node detects that other is down it will share that information in the next cycle.</p>
             <p>Press "Delete" and start clicking in some nodes to delete them.</p>
             <p>Once you're done, press "Delete" again to disable it and select one node to infect it, then press "Play"</p>
             <p>Yeaah? It converges again even though some nodes were down.</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Is it a real implementation?</h2>
          <p class="lead">If you take a look at the code, you won't see a real implementation of a Gossip protocol. This is because there is no reason for it. The goal of this simulator is to help understand how they work not how they're implemented. If we'd want to do it we would need to implement a transport layer to mimic tcp or udp, the best idea would be to use the messages as transport layer. In my github you can see a real implementation in clojure <a class="btn-lg " href="https://github.com/flopezluis/gossip" >here</a>&<a class="btn-lg" href="https://github.com/flopezluis/hyparview">here</a> </p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Doubts? <span class="text-muted">This will help.</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">In the simulator all the nodes seem to be synchronized, like there is one global cycle. This happens in the simulator because is easier for hte visualization but this is <span class="">NOT</span> what happens in a real gossip protocol. Each node has its own cycle and there is not synchronization at all.</p>
          <p class="lead"><span class="text-muted">How do the nodes know about each other?</span> That's a good question!</p><p class="lead"> There are several ways, depending on the implementation, for example in HyParView [6] when a node wishes to join the overlay, it must know another node that already belongs to the overlay. That node is callthe contact node. In Gossip protocols when two nodes exchange information, they also exchange the list of nodes thet have, in that way every cycle the view that each node has is updated.</p>
